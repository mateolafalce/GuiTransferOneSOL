  <h1>GUI Transfers one SOL üåü

</h1>

  This program, developed with fltk.rs, aims to provide a user interface for native SOL transfers on the Solana blockchain.

<h3 align="center">üìùApp logic</h3>

The app allows the user to send native SOL transfers on the Solana blockchain.

The application has three buttons: "Enter your Wallet", "Leave a message to the recipient" and "Send the Tx". When the user clicks "Enter your Wallet", a file selection dialog opens allowing the user to select a JSON file containing their wallet information. The wallet information is stored using the store_wallet function. When the user clicks "Send the Tx", the program sends the SOL transfer using the extracted wallet information and the message provided by the user.

The code snippet also creates a top bar that contains the Solana logo and the title of the app.

<h4 align="center">Dependencies</h4>

Here are the dependencies used in this application:

- **fltk version 1.4.1**: A cross-platform graphical user interface toolkit used for building the user interface of the application.

- **transfer_one_sol** with no-entrypoint feature: A Rust crate that provides functions for sending a native SOL transfer on the Solana blockchain. The no-entrypoint feature is used to exclude the entrypoint function that is not needed in this application.

- **shellexpand version 2.1.0**: A crate used for expanding tilde and environment variables in paths.

- **anchor-client version 0.26.0** with debug feature: A Rust crate that provides a client for the Anchor framework used to interact with Solana programs.

- **serde_json version 1.0.94**: A Rust crate that provides serialization and deserialization of JSON data.

- **serde version 1.0.158**: A framework used to derive serialization and deserialization implementations for Rust data structures.

- **tokio version 1.26.0**: A runtime for writing reliable asynchronous applications in Rust. It is used in this application to spawn a task for sending the SOL transfer asynchronously.

<h4 align="center">Usage</h4>

To run the application, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
This will launch the application and allow you to start sending SOL transfers on the Solana blockchain.

![save_wallet](src/save_wallet.gif)

In the logic program the module exports a function called store_wallet that takes a Vec<u8> representing a new wallet and writes it to a JSON file named "src/wallet.json". The function first reads the existing wallet from the file, updates it with the new wallet, and then writes the updated wallet back to the file.

The Wallet struct is defined with a public wallet field of type Vec<u8>. This struct is derived from the Debug, Deserialize, and Serialize traits provided by the serde library. These traits enable serialization and deserialization of the Wallet struct to and from JSON format.
